# gstcefsrc

## Build

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```
#### Windows Build: ####

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

* *Note:* Add Debug folder to Path and GST_PLUGIN_PATH environment variables.

### Optional CMake variables

- `CEF_VERSION` allows to override the default CEF version
- `CEF_BUILDS_HOMEPAGE_URL` allows to configure the URL of the website hosting
  CEF binaries. Default is https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com

### Third-party CEF builds

The official CEF builds hosted by Spotify do not support patent-encumbered
codecs such as H.264. If that is a feature you need in your project or for some
reason you need to customize the Chromium build flags, you need to rebuild CEF
yourself. Thankfully at least two projects can help you with that daunting task:

- https://github.com/reinismu/cefbuild : Docker to build cef with all codecs
- https://github.com/philn/cef-build-box : Semi-automatic and reproducible CEF build

## Preparation

On macOS, CEF tests at multiple steps that it is being loaded from within an
application bundle. This means that when you call e.g. `gst-launch-1.0`, it must
first be turned into a macOS app. To do this, you can follow these steps:

1. Move `<path to GStreamer.framework/Versions/1.0>/bin/gst-launch-1.0` to `<path to GStreamer.framework/Versions/1.0>/bin/gst-launch-1.0.app/Contents/MacOS/gst-launch-1.0`
2. Symlink `<path to GStreamer.framework/Versions/1.0>/bin/gst-launch-1.0.app/Contents/MacOS/gst-launch-1.0` to `<path to GStreamer.framework/Versions/1.0>/bin/gst-launch-1.0`
3. Paste the XML file below into `<path to GStreamer.framework/Versions/1.0>/bin/gst-launch-1.0.app/Contents/Info.plist`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>CFBundleGetInfoString</key>
  <string>GStreamer</string>
  <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>
  <string>gst-launch-1.0</string>
  <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
  <string>org.gstreamer.GStreamer</string>
  <key>CFBundleName</key>
  <string>gst-launch-1.0</string>
  <key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key>
  <string>1.0</string>
  <key>CFBundleInfoDictionaryVersion</key>
  <string>6.0</string>
  <key>CFBundlePackageType</key>
  <string>APPL</string>
  <key>NSPrincipalClass</key>
  <string>NSApplication</string>
  <key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>
  <string>True</string>
  <key>LSMinimumSystemVersion</key>
  <string>10.13.0</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

After this, you can run the steps below, replacing `gst-launch-1.0` with
`<path to GStreamer.framework/Versions/1.0>/bin/gst-launch-1.0.app/Contents/MacOS/gst-launch-1.0`.

## Run

The element can then be tested with:

``` shell
GST_PLUGIN_PATH=Release:$GST_PLUGIN_PATH gst-launch-1.0 \
    cefsrc url="https://soundcloud.com/platform/sama" ! \
    video/x-raw, width=1920, height=1080, framerate=60/1 ! cefdemux name=d d.video ! \
    queue max-size-bytes=0 max-size-buffers=0 max-size-time=3000000000 ! videoconvert ! \
    xvimagesink audiotestsrc do-timestamp=true is-live=true  volume=0.00 ! audiomixer name=mix ! \
    queue max-size-bytes=0 max-size-buffers=0 max-size-time=3000000000 ! audioconvert ! pulsesink \
    d.audio ! mix.
```

Record website video + audio (with audiomixer)

``` shell
GST_PLUGIN_PATH=Release:$GST_PLUGIN_PATH gst-launch-1.0 -e \
    cefsrc url="https://soundcloud.com/platform/sama" ! \
    video/x-raw, width=1920, height=1080, framerate=60/1 ! \
    cefdemux name=demux ! queue ! videoconvert ! \
    queue max-size-bytes=0 max-size-buffers=0 max-size-time=3000000000 ! x264enc ! queue ! \
    mp4mux name=muxer ! filesink location='test.mp4' \
    audiotestsrc do-timestamp=true is-live=true  volume=0.0 ! audiomixer name=mix ! \
    queue max-size-bytes=0 max-size-buffers=0 max-size-time=3000000000 ! audioconvert ! \
    audiorate ! audioresample ! faac bitrate=128000 ! queue ! muxer. \
    demux. ! queue ! mix.
```

This will work with sites with no audio as well

`cefsrc` requires an X server environment on Linux, if none is available you can
run the previous commands with `xvfb-run`:

`xvfb-run --server-args="-screen 0 1920x1080x60" gst-launch-1.0 ...`

In addition, a wrapper bin is exposed, wrapping cefsrc and cefdemux, and
handling `web+http`, `web+https` and `web+file` protocols:

``` shell
GST_PLUGIN_PATH=Release:$GST_PLUGIN_PATH gst-launch-1.0 \
    cefbin name=cef cefsrc::url="https://soundcloud.com/platform/sama" \
    cef.video ! video/x-raw, width=1920, height=1080, framerate=60/1 ! videoconvert ! xvimagesink \
    cef.audio ! audioconvert ! audiomixer ! autoaudiosink
```

``` shell
gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=web+https://www.soundcloud.com/platform/sama
```

### Note on Global CEF Parameters

This note is only relevant if you want to run multiple cefsrc instances in the same process.

Prior releases of this plugin exposed some CEF properties that are in fact global to a single process.
We have now deprecated use of these as cefsrc element properties and instead exposed them as environment
variables. These properties are listed here for reference along with the env var that replaces them:

- `cef-cache-location` - set GST_CEF_CACHE_LOCATION instead
- `chrome-extra-flags` - set GST_CEF_CHROME_EXTRA_FLAGS
- `chromium-debug-port` - set GST_CEF_CHROME_EXTRA_FLAGS
- `gpu` - set GST_CEF_GPU_ENABLED
- `log-severity` - set GST_CEF_LOG_SEVERITY
- `sandbox` - set GST_CEF_SANDBOX

Note that if you do require pipelines / applications that run multiple `cefsrc` instances with differing
values for the above properties, we recommend running these source sections in a separate process and
bring the resulting frames into your main process using something like the
[`ipc`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/ipcpipeline/index.html?gi-language=c) plugins.

## Docker GPU Acceleration

This is simply a hint/note for those who want to use this plugin in a docker container with GPU acceleration. Your particular setup may vary. The following was tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with a Nvidia GPU. This assumes you have installed the Nvidia drivers, docker, and the Nvidia Container Toolkit. You may also need to configure your xorg.conf within the container to use the Nvidia GPU.

- xserver-xorg-video-dummy is required in the container

Running docker with the following flags will allow the container to access the host's GPU:

``` shell
docker run --gpus all -v /usr/local/cuda:/usr/local/cuda --device=/dev/dri/card0 --rm \
-e DISPLAY=:1 -v /tmp/X11-unix:/tmp/.X11 -it <image> /bin/bash
```

Inside the container run:

``` shell
Xorg -noreset +extension GLX +extension RANDR \+extension RENDER -logfile ./xserver.log vt1 :1 &
```

Test that the GPU is accessible by running:

``` shell
GST_CEF_CHROME_EXTRA_FLAGS="use-gl=egl, enable-gpu-rasterization,ignore-gpu-blocklist" \
GST_CEF_GPU_ENABLED="set" gst-launch-1.0 -e cefsrc url="chrome://gpu" \
  ! video/x-raw, width=1920, height=8080, framerate=1/1 \
  ! cefdemux name=demux ! queue ! videoconvert \
  ! pngenc ! multifilesink location="frame%d.png"
```

It is also helpful to run nvidia-smi or nvtop to verify the GPU is being used. Note it is possible to use the GPU within a kube pod as well. This has been tested and runs in a production environment on GKE using Container Optimized OS.

## Javascript Signals

There is an optional feature in the cefsrc element that allows the webpage to send signals to
cefsrc:

- "ready" - signals that the page content is ready to be rendered, and the src will then start
  capturing and pushing buffers
- "eos" - signals that the webpage has no more content and to push an EOS event out on the
  cefsrc's src pad

Two methods are attached to the javascript global `window` object: `gstSendMsg` and
`gstCancelMsg`. For example, here is how you would send the "ready" signal:

```js
window.gstSendMsg({
  request: "ready",
  onSuccess: function(response) {
    try {
      const json = JSON.parse(response);
      showResult(response, json, "response");
      if (json && json.success) {
        // message processed by cefsrc successfully
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("parse error", e);
    }
  },
  onFailure: function(error_code, error_message) {
    try {
      const json = JSON.parse(error_message);
      showResult(response, JSON.stringify(json), "error");
    } catch (e) {
    console.error("parse error", e);
    }
  }
});
```
